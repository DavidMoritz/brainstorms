# Choose a Game

Build an app that asks a series of questions to help people determin which game to play. (Spin off: idea could be used for movies, TV series, etc.)

### Create Tags

* Each tag needs to represent a positive boolean. (e.g. work-placement)
* Each tag also has an associated question. (e.g. "How do you feel abou worker-placement?")
* At any point, the user is able to see how many results are available can click "Choose one" to see one picked of the results.
* A user can also "pass" on a question.
* When adding a game to the database, we can ask the same questions, but in reverse order.
